    "\n",
    "The sample dataset from NLTK is separated into positive and negative tweets. It contains 5000 positive tweets and 5000 negative tweets exactly. The exact match between these classes is not a coincidence. The intention is to have a balanced dataset. That does not reflect the real distributions of positive and negative classes in live Twitter streams.\n",

    "### What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NLTK sample dataset you mentioned, there are 5000 positive tweets and 5000 negative tweets. This equal distribution of positive and negative tweets is intentional and serves the purpose of creating a balanced dataset for training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that this balanced dataset does not accurately reflect the real distribution of positive and negative tweets in live Twitter streams. In real-time, the occurrence of positive and negative tweets can vary significantly based on several factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, it's common to observe imbalanced distributions of positive and negative tweets. This imbalance presents challenges when training and evaluating machine learning models that have been trained on a balanced dataset. The models may not generalize well to imbalanced distributions and may exhibit biases or limitations when applied to real-time Twitter streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address such challenges, specialized techniques for handling imbalanced data can be employed, such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using advanced algorithms that handle imbalanced data effectively. Additionally, incorporating contextual information, topic modeling, or sentiment analysis techniques can further improve the understanding and analysis of sentiment in live Twitter streams."

    " * **learn**ed\n",
    " * **learn**t\n",
    " \n",
    "All these words are stemmed from its common root **learn**. However, in some cases, the stemming process produces words that are not correct spellings of the root word. For example, **happi** and **sunni**. That's because it chooses the most common stem for related words. For example, we can look at the set of words that comprises the different forms of happy:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **happ**y\n",

    " * **happi**er\n",
    " \n",
    "We can see that the prefix **happi** is more commonly used. We cannot choose **happ** because it is the stem of unrelated words like **happen**.\n",
    " \n",
    "NLTK has different modules for stemming and we will be using the [PorterStemmer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.html#module-nltk.stem.porter) module which uses the [Porter Stemming Algorithm](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/). Let's see how we can use it in the cell below."

    "### What is `TfidVectorizer`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF**: TF-IDF is a way to measure the importance of words in a document. It considers two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a word appears in a document.\n",
    "**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How common or rare a word is across all documents.\n",
    "TF-IDF gives higher weight to words that appear frequently in a document but less frequently in the entire collection of documents. This helps to highlight important words that are unique to specific documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization**: TfidfVectorizer converts text documents into numbers, allowing us to perform calculations and analysis on the text. It represents each document as a numerical vector. The vector contains information about the importance of different words in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction**: TfidfVectorizer performs preprocessing on text documents. It breaks down the text into individual words, converts them to lowercase, and removes unnecessary words like \"the\" or \"and\". It also considers sequences of words (n-grams) to capture more contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: TfidfVectorizer has options to customize its behavior. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**max_features** limits the number of words (features) used in the vectorization process.\n",
    "**ngram_range** determines the size of word sequences to consider (e.g., single words, pairs of words, etc.).\n",
    "**stop_words** specifies a list of common words to ignore during vectorization.\n",
    "**use_idf** controls whether IDF weighting is applied.\n",
    "**Fit and Transform**: To use TfidfVectorizer, you first fit it on your training data to learn the vocabulary and calculate the TF-IDF values. Then, you can transform new documents using the same vectorizer, ensuring consistent representation across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, TfidfVectorizer helps convert text documents into meaningful numerical representations. It considers word importance based on frequency and rarity, and it allows you to customize its behavior. By fitting and transforming the data, you can use the resulting numerical matrix for various analysis tasks."
